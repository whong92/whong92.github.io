Hi there, my name is Wai Hong. I'm a software / machine learning engineer currently living in the UK, but seeking my next big adventure anywhere else in the world.

My journey starts with me majoring in Mechanical Engineering as an undergrad at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) Fall of 2011. I then went on to work as a physicist in a [Research Lab](https://www.cambridgemechatronics.com/en/) in Cambridge, developing mathematical models and algorithms for controlling certain [exotic materials](https://www.cambridgemechatronics.com/en/cml-technology/).

I went back to Imperial to get a Master's in Computer Science in the Fall of 2017. Since then I've worked at a [Hedge Fund](https://bmlltech.com/) as well as in [Cyber Security](https://www.jazznetworks.com/).

I currently work as a computer vision / machine learning engineer at a [Ava](https://vaion.com/), a unified physical-cyber security company. I design and architect computer vision models, mostly using deep learning and convolutional neural networks, to analyse hundreds or sometimes thousands of streams of video and image data, on a single GPU, to deliver what we call 'always on' analytics.

While my professional experience mostly involve developing deep-learning based Computer Vision models, I've also branched out into [Recommender Systems](https://github.com/whong92/recommender). Do visit my [github](https://github.com/whong92) to see what I've been working on!

I am interested in all things math, mostly to do with machine learning, but I occasionally dabble in other fun stuff like graph and number theory, which I find pretty fascinating. I have chosen to use this space to document what I learn, as I learn them, so be prepared for frequent revisions to blog posts that I've realized I've done wrongly.
